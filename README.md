# File Integrity Checker

## About the Project

This was my first time ever handling files in Python, and it was a great learning experience! Previously, I worked on three projects that involved creating games, so this project was completely different and exciting for me. It challenged me to step out of my comfort zone and dive into the world of file handling and binary reading, which was entirely new territory.

## Importance of This Project

The File Integrity Checker serves as an essential tool for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of files. By leveraging hashing techniques, this project provides a reliable way to verify whether two files are identical or have been altered. This functionality is crucial in scenarios such as:

- **Data Integrity Verification**: Ensuring files remain unchanged during transfers or storage.
- **Version Control**: Identifying differences between file versions.
- **Cybersecurity**: Detecting unauthorized modifications to files.
- **Backup Validation**: Confirming that backups are complete and uncorrupted.

## Functionality

The File Integrity Checker calculates the SHA-1 hash of two files and compares them to determine their integrity. Its main functionalities include:

- Reading files in binary mode to handle diverse file types.
- Efficiently processing large files in manageable chunks.
- Generating and comparing hash values to check for discrepancies.

This straightforward yet powerful approach makes it a practical tool for various file verification tasks.

## What I Learned

- **File Handling**: Reading files in Python, especially in binary mode, was a new concept for me. I learned how to open files, read them in chunks, and handle large files efficiently.
- **Using `hashlib`**: This project introduced me to the `hashlib` library, which was instrumental in creating file hashes using the SHA-1 algorithm. It was fascinating to see how hashes can be used to verify file integrity.
- **Object-Oriented Concepts**: By working with objects like `hash_Object`, I started to understand how objects work and how they can make code more organized and reusable.
- **Binary Reading**: Reading files in binary mode was a new concept, and it taught me how data is represented and handled at a lower level.

## Why I Loved This Project

This project was a rewarding experience because it allowed me to explore new areas of Python programming. I enjoyed the challenge of working with files, understanding how file comparison works, and learning about hash functions. It was different from my previous projects, and I feel more confident in my ability to handle diverse programming tasks.

## Next Steps

While this project was a significant milestone, I recognize that there is still so much more to learn about file handling, hashing algorithms, and Python programming. I am excited to continue building projects that expand my knowledge and skills.
